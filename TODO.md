When the user clicks "start..."
- time will begin at [0,0,0] and increase by [0,0,1] intervals in ascending order
- once [0,0,x] hits [0,0,60] the timer will change to [0,1,0] (the same applies for [2])
- the background color pattern will also change based on time elapsed in second intervals

When the user hovers over the time...
- time will transform to evolving color changes
- the background color changes will evolve by it's last value
